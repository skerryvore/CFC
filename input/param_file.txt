! Radius of the circle (in km)
!25
! Name of the DEM file, note that the program is going to check if a highpass topography file exist
! file_name.flt, if not the file will be created and the calculation could take time
! My advice would be to filter the topography using a dedicated GIS software such as GRASS.
! In that case the file will have to use UTM35S projection and WGS84 datum
! PROJECTION (1: LATLON, 2:UTM)
